    "\n",
    "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a projection refers to the transformation of data from its original high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace while retaining as much variance as possible. This is achieved by projecting the data onto a set of orthogonal axes called principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of PCA is to find a new basis (set of orthogonal vectors) such that when the data is projected onto this new basis, the variance of the projected data is maximized. The first principal component corresponds to the direction with the highest variance, the second principal component is orthogonal to the first and has the second highest variance, and so on.\n",
